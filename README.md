# Sound List
This is an easy way to add all / remove the sound commands to your chatbot.
Fill a folder with .mp3 files, name each file as the command you want it to be. 
Load up your chatbot, pass in the path to that folder, refresh your scripts, Set everything else and then the script will take care of playing all of those sounds as commands. 

**Example path** 

```G:\chatbot_sounds\mp3\```

*note: (the \ at the end is very important)*

**Additional Info**
- All sound commands will be the name with a ! at the start. For example a sound named:
"shouting" will become a command "!shouting". 
- After adding / changing the sounds path, the sounds list will not update until you refresh your scripts. 

I hope this script is useful for you, if you have any thoughts on it, raise a github issue with a suggestion or lemme know while I'm [streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/valverdian) or on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/valverdian)
